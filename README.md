### About Me
---

Hi, I'm Tony.
I am a Full Stack Software Engineer located at Sorocaba, SP - Brazil.
I have a degree in Computer Science and have been working with programming since 2010.

I have some experience with C#, NET Framework and Vue.js, but now my focus is Node.js, React and React Native.
Next steps are to include Rust and some functional programming language in my tool set.

Also learning some game programming with Unity, for a hobby. üòÅ
